# Scheduler

## Description
This application is an hourly calendar that allows you to organize your day, so you don't feel overwhelmed and forget any of your daily tasks. You can add a task to one of the blocks and save it. JQuery was mainly used and it updates the HTML/CSS docs. The  blocks should change colors depending if the saved tasks are in the past, present, or future. a
